Code for the "Wirelessly controlled Lighting systems" for Power Wildcard enterprise project.
This repository consists of code for our project titled "Wirelessly controlled Lighting systems". 
There is an android app designed which communicates with Raspberry Pi through a client-server socket communication. 
When you want to turn on the lights, you just push the "on" button on the app and Pi will take care of the rest.
Its a Internet of Things application which can be scaled beyond just lighting systems.
